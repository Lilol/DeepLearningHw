## Abstract

Convolution Neural Network (CNN) algorithms have been prominent models for image classification, but in recetn years Transformer based methods have also started to gain popularity and usage. In an attempt to get a clear view and understanding of the two architecture for image classification tasks on a cloud dataset of approximately 2000 data points, the project is designed to compare the charasteristics of CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT). For each models we provide a clear and comprehensive review of architectural and functional differences. Then we compare their computing capacity requirements, validation accuracy and training time on an online image dataset with our own implementation of input pipeline from scratch.
